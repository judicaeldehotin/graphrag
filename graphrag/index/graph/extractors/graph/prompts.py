-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Arm's (ARM) stock skyrocketed in its opening day on the Nasdaq Thursday. But IPO experts warn that the British chipmaker's debut on the public markets isn't indicative of how other newly listed companies may perform.
 
Arm, a formerly public company, was taken private by SoftBank in 2016. The well-established chip designer says it powers 99% of premium smartphones.

Text:
Five Americans jailed for years in Iran and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to the United States.
 
The last pieces in a controversial swap mediated by Qatar fell into place when $6bn (Â£4.8bn) of Iranian funds held in South Korea reached banks in Doha.
 
It triggered the departure of the four men and one woman in Tehran, who are also Iranian citizens, on a chartered flight to Qatar's capital.
 
They were met by senior US officials and are now on their way to Washington.
 
The Americans include 51-year-old businessman Siamak Namazi, who has spent nearly eight years in Tehran's notorious Evin prison, as well as businessman Emad Shargi, 59, and environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, 67, who also holds British nationality.
